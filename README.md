# Bike_sharing_prediction
# Project Objective:
In this project, we are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to 
predict bike rental demand.
# Methodology
# 1.EDA:
Performed EDA to get more informative features like null values,outliers,correlation and other features.
# 2.Model Bulding:
1. Linear Regression Model
2. DecisionTree Regressor Model
3. Randomforest Regressor Model
# 3.Model Validation:
 * Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)
# Insights:
We got RandomForest Regressor as the best model by considering the RMSLE.Then predicted the counts using this model.
